                    <p>To ensure we meet these standards, our customers are required to provide certain personal details and documents when opening a JDAX Account (“Identity Verification”). The nature and extent of the Identity Verification required will depend upon which of our supported countries you are resident in, and the deposit and withdrawal limits that you wish to apply to your JDAX Account. In certain circumstances, JDAX may also perform enhanced due diligence (“EDD”) procedures in relation to your JDAX Account. You accept and agree that you will remain subject to such procedures at all times.</p>
                    <p>JDAX reserves the right to, at any time:</p>
                    <ul>

                    <p><b>Retention of information.</b> JDAX is required to retain certain information and documentation obtained as part of the Identity Verification and EDD procedures. These requirements apply even when you have terminated your relationship with JDAX.

                    </h2>
                    <p>The JDAX Wallet allows you to send, receive and store digital currency (together, “JDAX Wallet Transactions”).</p>
                    <p><b>Supported Digital Currencies.</b> The JDAX Wallet is only available in relation to the digital currencies that JDAX, in its sole discretion, decides to support (“Supported Digital Currency” or “Supported Digital Currencies”). The Supported Digital Currencies may change from time to time. Under no circumstances should you attempt to carry out a JDAX Wallet Transaction in relation to a digital currency other than a Supported Digital Currency. In particular, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, you accept and agree that you will have no access, entitlement or claim:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>to any digital currency sent to a receive address associated with your JDAX Wallet where that digital currency is not a Supported Digital Currency; or</li>
                        <li>to any digital currency sent to a receive address associated with your JDAX Wallet, where that receive address is associated with another digital currency. For example, you will have no access, entitlement or claim to any Bitcoin Cash (BCH) sent to a Bitcoin (BTC) receive address.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Information about the Supported Digital Currencies can be found on the <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/countries" target="_blank">Fees and Features</a> page of the JDAX website.</p>
                    <p><b>Local Currency in your JDAX Wallet.</b> Local Currency deposited into your JDAX Wallet (see <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/en/legal/terms#deposits">Deposits</a>) is solely for (1) the purchase of Supported Digital Currencies and/or (2) Withdrawal to an approved bank account (see <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/en/legal/terms#withdrawals">Withdrawals</a>). In certain countries we may also allow you to purchase specific goods and/or services from selected third parties using your Local Currency balance (for example, Airtime in South Africa). You accept and agree that any such purchase will be subject to these Terms.</p>
                    <p>Proceeds from the sale of Supported Digital Currencies will be credited to your Local Currency JDAX Wallet, less any applicable fees (as explained in <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/en/legal/terms#fees">Fees</a>, and on the <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/countries" target="_blank">Fees and Features</a> page of the JDAX website). JDAX does not pay interest on Local Currency or Supported Digital Currency balances held in your JDAX Wallet.</p>
                    <p><b>Transaction instructions.</b> JDAX will process JDAX Wallet Transactions according to your instructions. You accept and agree that JDAX does not:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>guarantee the identity of any user, receiver, or other party to a JDAX Wallet Transaction. You are solely responsible for ensuring all transaction details are correct, and you should carefully verify all transaction information prior to submitting transaction instructions to JDAX;</li>
                        <li>have any control over, or any liability in relation to, the delivery, quality or any other aspect of any goods or services that you may buy from or sell to any third party. JDAX shall not be responsible for, and will take no action in relation to, ensuring that any buyer or seller you transact with using your JDAX Wallet completes the relevant transaction or has the requisite authority to do so.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Receiving digital currency.</b> You may receive Supported Digital Currency into your JDAX Wallet by providing the sender with a receive address generated in your JDAX Wallet. Your JDAX Wallet will only be credited with Supported Digital Currency sent to a receive address generated through your JDAX Wallet and associated with that Supported Digital Currency. For example, your JDAX Wallet will be credited with ETH when it is sent to an ETH receive address generated through your JDAX Wallet.</p>
                    <p><b>Funds received in error.</b> In the event you know, suspect, or should reasonably know or suspect, that any Local Currency or digital currency has been credited to your JDAX Wallet (or to any bank account) in error, you must immediately notify JDAX of the error by submitting a ticket through the <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/help" target="_blank">Help Centre</a>. You accept and agree that you have no claim or entitlement to any Local Currency or digital currency received in error, and must immediately return such funds in accordance with the instructions received from JDAX.</p>
                    <h2 id="deposits">
                        <li>DEPOSITS</li>
                    </h2>
                    <p>Where your identity has been verified (in accordance with the <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/en/legal/terms#identity_verification">Identity Verification</a> requirements), you may deposit Local Currency into your JDAX Wallet by depositing funds into a JDAX bank account (a “Deposit”).</p>
                    <p>Details of the JDAX bank account into which you must make the Deposit will be provided to you by JDAX, and any such bank account will be held and operated by a JDAX operating entity in your country or region (for more information on these entities, see the Company Information page on the JDAX website). You accept and agree that any information you provide to JDAX may be shared with such local entity, which will process Local Currency transactions in accordance with JDAX’s instructions.</p>
                    <p>The payment methods by which you may Deposit Local Currency will depend upon the country you are in, and are set out on the <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/countries" target="_blank">Fees and Features</a> page of the JDAX website (for the purposes of these Terms, the “Supported Deposit Methods”). Where you have made a Deposit using a Supported Deposit Method, and have adhered to the Deposit Requirements (explained below), your Deposit will be allocated to your JDAX Wallet.</p>
                    <p>Due to legal and operational constraints, you must strictly adhere to the following Deposit requirements (the “Deposit Requirements”):</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>you may only make a Deposit from a bank account (or other Supported Deposit Method) held in your own name. You must not allow any third party to make a Deposit into your JDAX Wallet;</li>
                        <li>you may only Deposit Local Currency from a bank account (or other Supported Deposit Method) compatible with the deposit methods available in your country or region;</li>
                        <li>except in the case of a SEPA transfer, you may only make Deposits denominated in the Local Currency associated with your JDAX Wallet. For example, if you have a ZAR wallet, you must only make Deposits in South African Rand;</li>
                        <li>you must not use cash or cheques to make a Deposit. JDAX reserves the right to refuse any Deposit made by cash or cheque. Should JDAX decide, in its sole discretion, to allow a Deposit by cash or cheque on an exceptional basis, the allocation of such Deposit will be delayed to allow fraud and compliance checks to take place, and a Cash Deposit Penalty (see the <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/countries" target="_blank">Fees and Features</a> page of the JDAX website) may be deducted from it. Any JDAX Account that receives more than one cash or cheque deposit may, at JDAX’s sole discretion, be suspended indefinitely.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>You agree to abide by the Deposit Requirements and agree and accept that failure to do so may cause delay in or failure of any Deposit reflecting in your JDAX Wallet, and/or restriction, suspension or termination of your JDAX Account.</p>
                    <p><b>Allocation of deposits.</b> When you request to make a Deposit through your JDAX Wallet, you will be provided with a Reference Number or Unique Deposit Amount. To permit timely and successful allocation of a Deposit to your JDAX Wallet, you must use the Reference Number or Unique Deposit Amount when you make an online bank transfer or use any other Supported Deposit Method. JDAX will not be responsible for any delay in or non-allocation of Deposits to your JDAX Wallet where you fail to specify the required Reference Number or Unique Deposit Amount.</p>
                    <p>Deposits may take time to reflect in your JDAX Wallet due to bank processing times, operational processes, and/or failure by you to adhere to the Deposit Requirements. Under no circumstances will JDAX have any liability to you in relation to any delay in or failure of a Deposit reflecting in your JDAX Wallet.</p>
                    <p>JDAX will make all reasonable efforts to allocate Deposits that do not meet the Deposit Requirements. However, any Deposits less than the Minimum Unallocated Deposit Amount that cannot be allocated within a one month period will be retained by JDAX and you accept and agree that you shall have no further claim or entitlement to such funds. The Minimum Unallocated Deposit Amount shall until otherwise determined by JDAX be USD10.00 or the equivalent in your Local Currency.</p>

                    <p>Where you have added your bank account details to your JDAX Account, you may withdraw funds from your JDAX Wallet to your bank account (a “Withdrawal”). JDAX will process Withdrawals in accordance with your instructions.

JDAX shall have no liability to you for or in connection with any unauthorised access to your JDAX Account, where such unauthorised access was due to no fault of JDAX, and/or any failure by you to act upon any notice or alert that we send to you.</p>
                    <p>The security of your JDAX Account may be compromised, or interruption caused to it, by phishing, spoofing or other attack, computer viruses, spyware, scareware, Trojan horses, worms or other malware that may affect your computer or other equipment. JDAX strongly recommends that you regularly use reputable virus screening and prevention software and remain alert to the fact that SMS, email services and search engines are vulnerable to spoofing and phishing attacks.</p>
                    <p>Care should be taken in reviewing messages purporting to originate from JDAX and, should you have any uncertainty regarding the authenticity of any communication, you should log in to your JDAX Account through the JDAX website (specifically, <a href="https://www.JDAX.com/" target="_blank">https://www.JDAX.com</a>, and not any other domain name or website purporting to be, or to be related to, JDAX) to review any transactions or required actions.</p>

For example, but without limiting the generality of the foregoing, JDAX will not:</p>

                        <li>allow the creation of any receive addresses associated with a Private Key other than receive addresses created through your JDAX Wallet. JDAX will not credit to your JDAX Wallet any digital currency associated with a Private Key other than where such funds have been received via a receive address generated through your JDAX Wallet.</li>

Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, we do not guarantee continuous access to the JDAX Site or your JDAX Account and make no representation that the JDAX Site, JDAX API, your JDAX Account and/or any products or services offered therein will be available without interruption; or that there will be no delays, failures, errors, omissions or loss of transmitted information.</p>

                    </h2>
                    <p>When you use your JDAX Account to send or receive digital currency, the transaction must be confirmed and recorded in the public ledger associated with the relevant digital currency network (e.g. the Bitcoin network or the Ethereum network). That digital currency network is solely responsible for verifying and confirming any such transactions. JDAX cannot confirm, cancel or reverse transactions on a digital currency network, other than confirming to you that the network has completed the transaction. You accept and agree that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Once submitted to a digital currency network, a transaction will be unconfirmed for a period of time pending sufficient confirmation of the transaction by the network. A transaction is not complete while it is in a pending state. Funds associated with transactions that are in a pending state will be designated accordingly, and will not be included in your JDAX Wallet balance or be available to you to conduct transactions;</li>
                        <li>When you send digital currency from your JDAX Account, you are authorising us to submit your transaction request to the relevant digital currency network. Once a transaction request has been submitted to the relevant digital currency network, the network will automatically complete or reject the request and neither you or JDAX will be able to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction.</li>
                        <li>Digital currency networks are operated by decentralised networks of independent third parties. They are not owned, controlled or operated by JDAX so we cannot ensure that any transaction details you submit will be confirmed by the relevant digital currency network. You agree that any transaction details you submit may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the digital currency network used to process the transaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><b>Network protocols and operating rules.</b> The underlying software protocols that govern the operation of the Supported Digital Currencies are open source. Accordingly, anyone can use, copy, modify, and distribute them and JDAX has no ownership of or control over these protocols. By using the JDAX Site, you accept and agree that:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>JDAX is not responsible for the operation of any digital currency network’s underlying software protocols and makes no guarantee as to their availability, security, or functionality;</li>
                        <li>the underlying software protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as “forks”), and that such forks may materially affect the value, function, and/or name of any digital currency you store in your JDAX Account. Should a fork occur, JDAX may, with or without notice to you, temporarily suspend our operations and, in our sole discretion, decide whether or not to support either branch of the forked protocol entirely; and</li>
                        <li>in the event JDAX decides not to support a branch of a forked protocol, you will not be given access to the assets on that fork. Those assets will be securely held by JDAX and we will not buy or sell them.</li>

You must not use your JDAX Wallet for the purpose of storing Local Currency. Where any Local Currency in your JDAX Wallet is not used for a period exceeding three months, JDAX may charge and obtain from you an Inactivity Fee of USD2.00 per month (or the equivalent in your Local Currency), which shall be collected from the Local Currency held in your JDAX Wallet. Should we have reasonable grounds on which to suspect you are using your JDAX Wallet primarily for the purpose of storing Local Currency, JDAX reserves the right to restrict, suspend or terminate your JDAX Account.</p>
